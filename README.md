# Educational Institution Network Implementation

A comprehensive hands-on project demonstrating enterprise network design and implementation using Cisco Packet Tracer.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project implements a complete network infrastructure for an educational institution, showcasing real-world networking concepts and security practices. The implementation covers three interconnected network segments serving different organizational functions with appropriate access controls and centralized services.

## üèóÔ∏è What You'll Build

**Network Architecture:**
- **Core Network**: Central infrastructure hosting DHCP, DNS, and web servers across 4 VLANs
- **Academia Edge**: Main campus network serving teachers, students, and IT support across 3 VLANs  
- **Remote Edge**: Distance learning network for remote students using 1 VLAN

**Key Technologies Implemented:**
- VLAN segmentation for network isolation
- Router-on-a-stick inter-VLAN routing
- OSPF dynamic routing between sites
- Centralized DHCP services with relay agents
- DNS services for internal name resolution
- Comprehensive security using Access Control Lists (ACLs)
- Wireless network integration with WPA2 security

## üè¢ Business Scenario

This project simulates a real educational institution with specific networking requirements:

**User Groups:**
- Management staff requiring administrative access
- IT support team needing comprehensive network access
- Teachers requiring access to educational resources and materials
- Students (both on-campus and remote) needing restricted access to learning resources

**Security Requirements:**
- Isolation between different user groups
- Controlled access to sensitive resources
- Prevention of unauthorized access between network segments
- Secure wireless access for mobile devices

**Operational Goals:**
- Centralized network service management
- Automatic IP address assignment across all segments
- Reliable internal name resolution
- Scalable design accommodating future growth

## üîß Network Specifications

**Core Network:**
- VLAN 100: Management (10.0.10.0/24) - DHCP Server, DNS Server
- VLAN 200: IT-Support (10.0.20.0/24) - IT Staff Resources
- VLAN 300: Teachers (10.0.30.0/24) - Teachers Web Server
- VLAN 400: Students (10.0.40.0/24) - Students Web Server

**Academia Edge Network:**
- VLAN 10: Teachers-Terminals (192.168.10.0/24) - Teacher Workstations
- VLAN 20: Students-Terminals (192.168.20.0/24) - Student Computer Labs
- VLAN 30: IT-Support-Terminals (192.168.30.0/24) - IT Management Stations

**Remote Edge Network:**
- VLAN 50: Students-Remote (172.16.50.0/24) - Remote Learning Access

## üîí Security Implementation

The network implements comprehensive security measures:

**Device Security:**
- Encrypted privileged access passwords
- Console and remote access authentication
- Secure device management practices

**Network Security:**
- VLAN-based traffic isolation
- Access Control Lists enforcing business policies
- Controlled inter-VLAN communication
- Wireless security using WPA2-PSK encryption

**Access Control Policies:**
- IT support staff granted full network access
- Teachers restricted to educational resources and teacher servers
- Students limited to student resources only
- Remote students granted controlled access to student services
- Explicit denial of unauthorized cross-VLAN access

## üìä Testing and Verification

The implementation includes comprehensive testing procedures:

**Connectivity Testing:**
- Verify VLAN isolation and inter-VLAN routing functionality
- Confirm DHCP service operation across all network segments
- Test DNS resolution for internal and external domains

**Security Verification:**
- Validate ACL enforcement of access control policies
